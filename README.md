## Getting started

### Get source code of the application

```console
$ cd /path/to/repos
$ git clone git@github.com:temaxuck/Brendwall-Technical-Assessment.git
$ cd Brendwall-Technical-Assessment
```

### Run the server
Before you run the server you have to ensure the migrated sqlite database exists.
Simply run (this will automatically create sqlite database and apply migrations for it):

```console
$ python3 manage.py migrate
```

Now you are able to run the server:

```console
$ python3 manage.py runserver
```

Finally, just open http://localhost:8000/.
